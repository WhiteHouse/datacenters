<h2 id="json-conversion-tool">JSON Conversion Tool</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>To assist agencies with preparation of their required DCOI Strategic Plans, a conversion tool for transferring text into a compatible, machine-readable JSON file is provided below. Agencies' final DCOI Strategic Plans then must be published at ‘agency’.gov/digitalstrategy/datacenteroptimizationstrategicplan.json according to the following deadlines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>FY 2016 DCOI Strategic Plans are due on or before September 30, 2016;</li>
    <li>FY 2017 DCOI Strategic Plans are due on or before April 14, 2017; and</li>
    <li>FY 2018 DCOI Strategic Plans are due on or before April 13, 2018. and</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Please enter the relevant data into each box. You can either enter the data manually or upload the data automatically.</p>

<p>To upload the data automatically, please click the ‘Load my own data’ button below, after which a new dialogue box will appear. In this box, please enter your data in a JSON format and then click the ‘Load data’ button at the bottom. Note that some boxes will only accept numerical data. In the event that the data does not match the parameters for a specific box, an error statement will appear below describing what sort of data is required to fix the error. <!-- Please note that some of the fields have been prepopulated and should not be edited. --></p>

<p>After filling in the data, either manually or by an upload, click the submit button at the very bottom. The tool will produce the entered data in a JSON format in a box at the very end. Copy this output into a text file and save it in a JSON format. **Please note that clicking submit does not mean that the output is actually submitted to OMB.** The output must be posted on agencies' ‘agency’.gov/digitalstrategy/ webpages. OMB will access these files using the links listed in the Agency Strategic Plan Locations page of this site. </p>

<p>NOTE that the DCOI also requires that agencies post data center-related milestones to their FITARAmilestones.json files describing steps the agency will take to achieve the goals of the DCOI. Guidance surrounding the DCOI milestones is located at <a href="https://management.cio.gov/schema" target="_blank">management.cio.gov/schema</a>. This tool does not address the DCOI milestones requirement of the DCOI.</p>
